It contains love, determination, some obstacles on the road and protagonist that learns a lot. Sadly, no fencing. But still a good story under every merit. It is a story about how I was learning about Elixir, programming language. See, as every hero in a story I started as totally incompetent character with no skills whatsoever.</p>

<p>And this blog is about that story, obstacles and determination. (Yes, I plan to write it, so if I stop, everybody would see I am a quitter.) The second reason is having some notes to which I can return to.</p>

<p><strong>Who is this blog for?</strong></p>

<p>Well, obviously, for me. It might be of some interest to you, if you try to learn  Elixir as your first language and you have NO technical background at all. Or you might find me mildly amusing in my failed attempt to learn something. Either way, beware of my hidden talent for mixing potions,... or not.</p>

<p><strong>The master plan</strong></p>

<p>The plan is to learn basics of elixir programming language and pick up any necessary skill along the way. I have a great teacher (see the first paragraph about love) and he was also the initiator of the idea. He wouldn&#39;t be the first IT guy who tried to teach his techno-stupid girl some command-line. But hopefully, he would be one of the more successful ones. He wanted to pick up new language, new and different and exciting language (no, not French) and the best way to learn is to teach. And for me? I will teach you, my non-existent reader. So, buckle up.</p>

<p>We are going through book Elixir 1.2 from Dave Thomas. He says it is functional, concurrent, pragmatic and fun. (...and this is the first time pragmatic and fun appeared in the same sentence) If you are also considering buying  the book while learning the language, first, don&#39;t take advice from people like me, and second, please do. I can see the examples are great and the way author approaches the subject is engaging and logical. Plus frequent Princes&#39; Bride references, what more do you need?</p>

<p>Actually I learned that words functional and concurrent are used quite a lot throughout the book. Functional, as in functional programming opposed to object-oriented and concurrent as in concurrent processes that are easier to manage.</p>

<p>Sorry for not containing any technical information in my first post, but I fear it is long enough already.</p>

<p>See you after first chapter. Wish me luck.</p>
